# EFI Tools KBase
This is a collection of KBase Apps that offer the same functionality as the Enzyme Function Initiative's [EFI Tools website](https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/). It uses [pyEFI](https://github.com/EnzymeFunctionInitiative/pyEFI) to access the core methods of EFITools and aims to integrate with data available on the KBase platform.
