    ssn_file:
        ui-name: SSN File upload
        short-hint: |
            SSNs generated by EFI-EST are compatible with GNT analysis (with the exception of SSNs from the FASTA sequences without the Read FASTA header option), even when they have been modified in Cytoscape. The accepted format is XGMML (or compressed XGMML as zip). 
    neighborhood_size:
        ui-name: Neighborhood Size
        short-hint: |
            The Pfam families for N neighboring genes upstream and downstream will be collected and analyzed. The default value is 10 and the minimum and maximum are 3 and 20, respectively.
    
    percentage_lower_limit:
        ui-name: Minimal Co-occurence Percentage Lower Limit
        short-hint: |
            Filters out the neighboring Pfams for which the co-occurrence percentage is lower than the set value (noise filter). The default value is 20 and valid values are 0-100.

    gnt_submission:
        ui-name: GNT Submission
        short-hint: |
            In a submitted SSN, each sequence is considered as a query. Information associated with protein encoding genes that are neighbors of input queries (within a defined window on either side) are collected from sequence files for bacterial (prokaryotic and archaeal) and fungal genomes in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database. The neighboring genes are sorted into neighbor Pfam families. For each cluster, the co-occurrence frequencies of the identified neighboring Pfam families with the input queries are calculated.
