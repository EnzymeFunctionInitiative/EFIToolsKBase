description: |
    <p> The EFI-GNT (Genome Neighborhood Tool) is focused on placing protein families and superfamilies into a genomic context. A sequence similarity network (SSN) is used as an input. Each sequence within a SSN is used as a query for interrogation of its genome neighborhood. EFI-GNT enables exploration of the genome neighborhoods for sequences in SSN clusters in order to facilitate their assignment of function. </p>

    <p> **EFI-GNT Acceptable Input.** The EFI-GNT is compatible with sequence similarity networks (SSNs) generated by the EFI-Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST) as well as SSNs that have been colored using the "Color SSN Utility". </p>

    <p> **Principle of the GNT Analysis.** For each cluster in the input SSN, EFI-GNT provides a statistical analysis of the genome context for bacterial, archeal, viral, and fungal sequences in the cluster to identify possible functional linkages between the SSN-clustered sequences and neighboring proteins. </p>

    <p> **EFI-GNT Output.** EFI-GNT identifies each SSN cluster and assigns it a unique color, producing a colored SSN. It then interrogates the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena"> European Nucleotide Archive</a> (ENA) to obtain the genome contexts of each sequence, sorts neighbors into Pfam families, and provides three specific outputs. Firstly, a Genome Neighborhood Network (GNN) in which each SSN cluster is a hub node with its spoke nodes consisting of identified neighboring Pfam families (helpful to identify candidates for pathway enzymes); secondly, a GNN in which each neighbor Pfam family is a hub node with its spoke nodes consisting of input SSN clusters that identify this Pfam as a neighbor (helpful to identify divergent clusters that are orthologues); and thirdly, a genome neighborhood diagram (GND) for visual representations of the neighborhoods for the sequences in each SSN cluster (for visual inspection of synteny and the presence/absence of functionally linked proteins). </p>

parameters:
    ssn_data_object:
        ui-name: SSN Data Object
        short-hint: |
            A SequenceSimilarityNetwork (SSN) data object generated by the EFIToolsKBase `EFI-EST SSN Creation` app. If the input SSN contains UniRef sequences, the resulting GNDs will also include GNDs for UniRef90 cluster IDs that group together UniProt sequences by 90% sequence identiy. For SSNs that also contain UniRef50 sequences, GNDs will also include UniProt sequences that are grouped by 50% sequence identity.
            
    nb_size:
        ui-name: Neighborhood Size
        short-hint: |
            Sets the number of neighboring genes to be considered in the GNT analysis. For each protein included in the input SSN, its N nearest neighbors will be gathered from both upstream and downstream, where N is this parameter's value. The Pfam families for these neighboring genes will be collected and analyzed. The default value is 10 with the accepted range being 3 to 20.
    
    cooc_threshold:
        ui-name: Minimal Co-occurence Percentage Lower Limit
        short-hint: |
            Filters out the neighboring Pfams for which the co-occurrence percentage is lower than the set value (noise filter). The default value is 20 with the accepted range being 0 to 100.

    gnd_object_name:
        ui-name: Name for the final GNDViewFile Object
        short-hint: |
            Short, descriptive filename (no spaces) to be used to name the GNDViewFile data object from this App. 
            
parameter-groups:
    gnt_submission:
        ui-name: GNT Submission
        short-hint: |
            In a submitted SSN, each sequence is considered as a query. Information associated with protein-encoding genes that are neighbors of input queries (within a defined window on either side) are collected from sequence files for bacterial (prokaryotic and archaeal) and fungal genomes in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database. The neighboring genes are sorted into neighbor Pfam families. For each cluster, the co-occurrence frequencies of the identified neighboring Pfam families with the input queries are calculated.
