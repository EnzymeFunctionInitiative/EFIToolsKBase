            A Cytoscape-edited SSN can serve as input. The accepted format is XGMML (or compressed XGMML as zip). The clusters are numbered and colored using two conventions: 1) Sequence Count Cluster Number assigned in order of decreasing number of UniProt IDs in the cluster; 2) Node Count Cluster Number assigned in order of decreasing number of nodes in the cluster.
