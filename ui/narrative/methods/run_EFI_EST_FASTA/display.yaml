parameters:
    fasta_sequences:
        ui-name: Sequences (paste)
        short-hint: |
            Input FASTA-formatted sequences with the selected accession IDs in the header. 
            
    fasta_sequences_file:
        ui-name: Sequences (upload)
        short-hint: |
            Upload FASTA-formatted sequences with the selected accession IDs in the header.
            
    header_format:
        ui-name: Header Format
        short-hint: |
            The database-format used in the FASTA headers
    
    fragment_option:
        ui-name: Exclude UniProt-defined fragments in the results
        short-hint: |
            Exclude UniProt-defined fragments in the results
        long-hint: |
            UniProt designates a Sequence Status for each member: Complete if the encoding DNA sequence has both start and stop codons; Fragment if the start and/or stop codon is missing. Approximately 10% of the entries in UniProt are fragments. 
    
    family_filter:
        ui-name: Input a list of Pfam families, InterPro families, and/or Pfam clans to restrict the UniProt and/or UniRef IDs in the SSN to these families.
        short-hint: |
            The input format is a single family or comma/space separated list of families. Families should be specified as PFxxxxx (five digits), IPRxxxxxx (six digits) or CLxxxx (four digits) for Pfam clans. 

    taxonomic_level:
        ui-name: Taxonomic Level
        short-hint: |
            Which level of taxomony to which the filter string is applied
    
    filter_string:
        ui-name: Filter string
        short-hint: |
            The filter to apply, may inlcude NOT at the beginning

    families_to_add:
        ui-name: Families
        short-hint: |
            The input format is a single family or comma/space separated list of families
        long-hint: |
            The input format is a single family or comma/space separated list of families. Families should be specified as PFxxxxx (five digits), IPRxxxxxx (six digits) or CLxxxx (four digits) for Pfam clans.

    use_alternate_cluster_id_format:
        ui-name: Use alternate cluster ID format
        short-hint: |
            Use selected cluster ID format instead of UniProt IDs
            
    fraction:
        ui-name: Fraction
        short-hint: |
            Selects every Nth sequence in the family; the sequences are assumed to be added randomly to UniProtKB, so the selected sequences are assumed to be a representative sampling of the family. This allows reduction of the size of the SSN. Sequences in the family with SwissProt annotations will always be included; this may result in the size of the resulting data set being slightly larger than the fraction specified.

    domain:
        ui-name: Sequences trimmed to the domain boundaries defined by the input family will be used for the calculations
        short-hint: |
            Sequences trimmed to the domain boundaries defined by the input family will be used for the calculations
    
    family_domain_bound:
        ui-name: Family
        short-hint: |
            Use domain boundaries from the specified family (enter only one family).
    
    region:
        ui-name: Region
        short-hint: |
            N-terminal will select the portion of the sequence that is N-terminal to the specified domain to generate the SSN. C-terminal will select the portion of the sequence that is C-terminal to the specified domain to generate the SSN. Domain will use the specified domain. 

    ssn_e_value:
        ui-name: Negative log of e-value for all-by-all BLAST
        short-hint: |
            Negative log of e-value for all-by-all BLAST
        long-hint: |
            Input an alternate e-value for BLAST to calculate similarities/edge alignment scores similarities. The default parameter (5) is useful for most sequences. However, a larger e-value/smaller negative log should be used for short sequences or when low pairwise identities may be useful for separating functionally distinct SSN clusters. 

    families_addition_cluster_id_format:
        ui-name: |
            Family Addition Format
        short-hint:
            The type of ID entered in the Families text box above

parameter-groups:
    fasta_input:
        ui-name: FASTA Input
        short-hint: |
            FASTA Input

    fragment_options:
        ui-name: Fragment Option
        short-hint: |
            Fragment Options
    family_filter_option:
        ui-name: Filter by Family
        short-hint: |

    taxonomy_filter_options:
        ui-name: Filter by Taxonomy
        short-hint: |
            A taxonomy filter is applied to the list of UniProt, UniRef90, or UniRef50 cluster IDs retrieved by the BLAST
    
    protein_family_addition_options:
        ui-name: Protein Family Addition Options
        short-hint:
            Add sequences belonging to Pfam and/or InterPro families to the sequences used to generate the SSN. 
    
    family_domain_boundary_option:
        ui-name: Family Domain Boundary Option
        short-hint: |
            Pfam and InterPro databases define domain boundaries for members of their families
    
    ssn_edge_calc_options:
