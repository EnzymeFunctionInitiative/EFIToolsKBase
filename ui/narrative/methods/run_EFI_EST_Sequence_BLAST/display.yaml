parameters:
    query_sequence:
        ui-name: Query Sequence
        short-hint: |
            The protein sequence to submit to BLAST
        long-hint: |
             The input sequence is used as the query for a search of the UniProt, UniRef90, or UniRef50 database using BLAST. For the UniRef90 and UniRef50 databases, the sequence of the cluster ID (representative sequence) is used for the BLAST. The database is selected using the BLAST Retrieval Options. An all-by-all BLAST is performed to obtain the similarities between sequence pairs to calculate edge values to generate the SSN. 
    e_value:
        ui-name: E-value
        short-hint: |
            Negative log of e-value for retrieving similar sequences (>= 1; default: 5)
        long-hint: |
            Input a larger e-value (smaller negative log) to retrieve homologues if the query sequence is short. Input a smaller e-value (larger negative log) to retrieve more similar homologues.
    
    max_sequences_retrieved:
        ui-name: Maximum sequences retrieved
        short-hint: |
            Maximum number of sequences retrived by BLAST
            
    sequence_database:
        ui-name: Sequence Database
        short-hint: |
            The Sequence databse to BLAST against
            
    fragment_option:
        ui-name: Exclude UniProt-defined fragments in the results
        short-hint: |
            Exclude UniProt-defined fragments in the results
        long-hint: |
            UniProt designates a Sequence Status for each member: Complete if the encoding DNA sequence has both start and stop codons; Fragment if the start and/or stop codon is missing. Approximately 10% of the entries in UniProt are fragments. 

    taxonomic_level:
        ui-name: Taxonomic Level
        short-hint: |
            Which level of taxomony to which the filter string is applied
    
    filter_string:
        ui-name: Filter string
        short-hint: |
            The filter to apply, may inlcude NOT at the beginning

    ssn_e_value:
        ui-name: Negative log of e-value for all-by-all BLAST
        short-hint: |
            Negative log of e-value for all-by-all BLAST
        long-hint: |
            Input an alternate e-value for BLAST to calculate similarities/edge alignment scores similarities. The default parameter (5) is useful for most sequences. However, a larger e-value/smaller negative log should be used for short sequences or when low pairwise identities may be useful for separating functionally distinct SSN clusters. 

    families_to_add:
        ui-name: Families
        short-hint: |
            The input format is a single family or comma/space separated list of families
        long-hint: |
            The input format is a single family or comma/space separated list of families. Families should be specified as PFxxxxx (five digits), IPRxxxxxx (six digits) or CLxxxx (four digits) for Pfam clans.

    use_alternate_cluster_id_format:
        ui-name: Use alternate cluster ID format
        short-hint: |
            Use selected cluster ID format instead of UniProt IDs

    families_addition_cluster_id_format:
        ui-name: |
            Family Addition Format
        short-hint:
            The type of ID entered in the "Families" text box above
            
    fraction:
        ui-name: |
             Reduce the number of sequences used to a fraction of the full family size
        short-hint: |
            Selects every Nth sequence in the family; the sequences are assumed to be added randomly to UniProtKB, so the selected sequences are assumed to be a representative sampling of the family. This allows reduction of the size of the SSN. Sequences in the family with SwissProt annotations will always be included; this may result in the size of the resulting data set being slightly larger than the fraction specified.

            Parameters for BLAST
    
    taxonomy_filter_options:
        ui-name: Filter by Taxonomy
        short-hint: |
            A taxonomy filter is applied to the list of UniProt, UniRef90, or UniRef50 cluster IDs retrieved by the BLAST
            
    protein_family_addition_options:
        ui-name: Protein Family Addition Options
        short-hint:
            Add sequences belonging to Pfam and/or InterPro families to the sequences used to generate the SSN.
