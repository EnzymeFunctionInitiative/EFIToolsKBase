            The genomic neighborhoods are retreived for the UniProt, NCBI, EMBL-EBI ENA, and PDB identifiers that are provided in the input box below. Not all identifiers may exist in the EFI-GNT database so the results will only include diagrams for sequences that were identified. 
            
    sequence_database:
        ui-name: Sequence database
        short-hint: |
            If the Sequence Database is set to UniRef90, the resulting GNDs will also include GNDs for UniRef90 cluster IDs that group together UniProt sequences by 90% sequence identiy. For UniRef50, the GNDs will also include UniProt sequences that are grouped by 50% sequence identity. Any of the Exclude Fragments options will exclude UniProt-defined sequence fragments.
