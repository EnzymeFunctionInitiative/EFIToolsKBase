    sequence:
        ui-name: Sequence
        short-hint: |
            The provided sequence is used as the query for a BLAST search of the UniProt database. The retrieved sequences are used to generate genomic neighborhood diagrams. 
            
    max_blast_sequences:
        ui-name: Maximum BLAST Sequences
        short-hint: |
            Maximum number of sequences retrieved
            
    e_value:
        ui-name: E-Value
        short-hint: |
            Negative log of e-value for all-by-all BLAST

    neighborhood_window_size:
        ui-name: Neighborhood window size
        short-hint: |
            Number of neighbors to retrieve on either side of the query sequence for each BLAST result
            
    sequence_database:
        ui-name: Sequence database
        short-hint: |
            If the Sequence Database is set to UniRef90, the resulting GNDs will also include GNDs for UniRef90 cluster IDs that group together UniProt sequences by 90% sequence identiy. For UniRef50, the GNDs will also include UniProt sequences that are grouped by 50% sequence identity. Any of the Exclude Fragments options will exclude UniProt-defined sequence fragments.
