parameters:
    ssn_file:
        ui-name: SSN File upload
        short-hint: |
            A Cytoscape-edited SSN can serve as input. The accepted format is XGMML (or compressed XGMML as zip). 

    min_node_count:
        ui-name: Minimum Node Count
        short-hint: |
            Minimum number of nodes in order to include a cluster in the computations
    
    max_node_count:
        ui-name: Maximum Node Count
        short-hint: |
            Maximum number of nodes to include in the MSA

    msa_web_logos:
        ui-name: Make Weblogo
        short-hint: |
            Make Weblogos for each cluster
    
    consensus_residue_list:
        ui-name: Residues to compute for (comma-separated list of amino acid codes)
        short-hint: |
            Residues to compute for (comma-separated list of amino acid codes)
            
    consensus_residue_thresholds:
        ui-name: Percent identity threshold(s) for determining conservation
        short-hint: |
            Percent identity threshold(s) for determining conservation (multiple comma-separated values allowed)

    make_hmms:
        ui-name: Make HMMs
        short-hint: |
            The MSA for the (length-filtered) node IDs is used to generate the HMM with hmmbuild from HMMER3
            
    make_length_histogram:
        ui-name: Make Length Histograms
        short-hint: |
            Make length histograms for each cluster
            
parameter-groups:
    cluster_analysis:
        ui-name: Cluster Analysis
        short-hint: |
            Clusters in the submitted SSN are identified, numbered and colored using two conventions: Sequence Count Cluster Numbers are assigned in order of decreasing number of UniProt IDs in the cluster; Node Count Cluster Numbers are assigned in order of decreasing number of nodes in the cluster. 

    sequence_filter:
        ui-name: Sequence Filter
        short-hint: |
            The MSA is generated with MUSCLE using the node IDs. Clusters containing less than the Minimum Node Count will be excluded from the analyses. Since MUSCLE can fail with a large number sequences (variable; anywhere from >750 to 1500), the Maximum Node Count parameter can be used to limit the number of sequences that MUSCLE uses. 
    
    weblogos:
        ui-name: WebLogos
        short-hint: |
            Provides the WebLogo and MSA for the node IDs in each cluster containing greater than the Minimum Node Count specified in the Sequence Filter. The percent identity matrix for the MSA is also provided. 
            
    consensus_residues:
        ui-name: Consensus Residues
        short-hint: |
            Provides a tab-delimited text file with the number of the conserved residues and their MSA positions for each specified residue in each cluster containing greater than the Minimum Node Count. Note the default residue is C and the percent identity levels that are displayed are from 90 to 10% in intervals of 10%; a residue is counted as conserved if it occurs with â‰¥80% identity. 

    hmms:
        ui-name: HMMs
        short-hint: |
            Provides the HMM for each cluster containing greater than the specified Minimum Node Count. 

    length_histogram:
        ui-name: Length Histograms
        short-hint: |
            Length histograms for the node IDs (where applicable, UniProt, UniRef90, and UniRef50 IDs).
